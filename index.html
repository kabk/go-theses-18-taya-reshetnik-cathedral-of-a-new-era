<div class='header'>THE CATHEDRAL OF A NEW ERA</div>

<div class='text'id='first'><strong>Subject of the research</strong>
	The subject of my research is the influence of media on physical space through the example of architecture of Utrecht Central Station. Societies have always been shaped more by the nature of the media by which men communicate rather then by the content of the communication. The way we think and perceive information has changed and I am investigating into how it influenced our approach towards organising space and its visual character.
</div>

    <div class='text'id='second'><strong>Research question</strong>
    	First of all, I am looking at the development of communication methods and how it influenced society in the past. I use examples of how invention of alphabet, writing and print influenced communication and social behaviour and compare it to the situation happening nowadays.
    </div>

        <div class='text'id='third'><strong>Hypothesis</strong>
        	The architecture of Utrecht Central has distinct characteristics of a shopping mall and so-called ‘junkspace’. There are number of reasons for such a direction in the development of public spaces. Consumer-orientated, disposable approach in design and architecture brought by post-modern ideology. However, I see that there is more to it. In my opinion media that we use for communication and exchanging information plays an important role as well. 
        </div>

            <div class='text'id='fourth'><strong>Central assumptions</strong>
            	The aspect of human communication has always fascinated me. In my point of view our attempt to find an understanding manifests its failure in a very physical way–through architecture of public spaces.  
            </div>

                <div class='text'id='fifth'><strong>Research method</strong>
                    The starting point of the thesis was observation and personal experience of travelling through Utrecht Central during my internship for the period of 3 months. Afterwards, I started asking other people about their experience and researching various material on urban planning, mallification and development of media and communication.
                </div>

                    <div class='text'id='sixth'><strong>So far</strong>
                        Through my research I found that there has always been concern that new media and methods of communicating are going to damage society in some way. However, going against the progress never worked out. As a result societies would inevitably change, and these changes could be seen in every aspect of social and personal life. 
                    </div>
                        <div class='text'id='seventh'><strong>What else</strong>
                            Graphic designers play a big role in how the sphere of communication and distribution of information, and I find it interesting that following this logic, one could assume that a graphic designer can have a very direct influence on the physical space and architecture.
