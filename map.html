                <div class='title'id='ABSTRACT'>ABSTRACT</div>
            The subject of my research is the influence of electronic media on physical space. Societies have always been shaped more by the nature of the media by which men communicate rather then by the content of the communication. Moreover electronic media has a direct physical impact on the way our brain is functioning. The way we think and perceive information is being changed. And my thesis is focusing on how these changes are influencing architecture and urban landscape in particular. <br>
            I would like to discern the role of graphic design in architecture and to point out the spheres where it is playing a key role. Graphic design is commonly being considered as a 2-dimensional practice, resulting in print or a digital product. However I see a strong connection in how its influence spreading further, on a larger scale of architecture and urban planning. For example, screens become a part of the architecture of the public space, and the content of the visuals influence the dynamics and social behaviour within these spaces. At the train stations and shopping malls the message coming from these screens is predominantly commercial and serve as a distraction and stimulator for consumerism. If graphic designers together with architects would create the content of these screens themselves and use it in the benefit of navigation and in favour of overall atmosphere, the station or a shopping mall could look entirely different–not only the content of the screen would change, but the use of it, and assumably the way the building is organised in the first place. <br>
            The architecture of Utrecht Central, as well as many other public spaces, has distinct features of mallification (a process of turning into a mall) and a so-called ‘junkspace’. These tendencies do not just happen, and among the consumer-orientated design with planned obsolescence, new media and graphic design are shaping these tendencies as well. <br>
            My central assumption within this thesis is that media is forming the perception and ways of thinking which leads to changes in how we approach urban planning and architecture. And since graphic design is responsible for communication and translation of information into a visual message, it stands behind that influence as well. I want to point out that the influence of graphic design goes out of the 2D canvas and has a wider, tangible affect. <br>
            Observation and personal experience of travelling through Utrecht Central during my internship for the period of 3 months became the starting point of this research. When talking about my experience I found out that I am not the only one concerned with overwhelming mallification and standartisation of public spaces. <br>
            Amongst all I figured that there has always been concern that new media is going to damage society in some way. However, protesting against the progress never worked out. As a result societies would inevitably change, and these changes could be seen in every aspect of social and personal life. <br>
            First of all, I am looking at the development of communication methods and how it influenced society in the past. I use examples of how invention of alphabet, writing and print influenced communication and social behaviour and compare it to the situation happening nowadays. <br>
            Graphic designers play a big role in the sphere of communication and distribution of information, and translating it to the audience, architects as well. Graphic design has the power of shaping the way how the media is going to influence our mins and how eventually the world around us is going to look and function. <br>
            Media shapes perception.<br>
            Perception influences physical space.<br>

        <div class='societyone' id='societyoneone'>
                <div class='title2'id='desire'>DESIRE FOR COMMUNICATION</div>
        I believe that the desire for communication is one of the major driving forces in this world. The desire to understand and to be understood. To find a common ground. To not feel alone locked away with your own thoughts. If you think about it, almost everything in our society is in a way a desperate attempt to establish a connection between each other. Communication is demanding for action and skills from both sides. It takes an effort, at least a common language. The deeper the connection is the more it seems to demand from both sides. And yet, no matter how much of an effort you push into sustaining the fragile link, there’s no way to reach someone else’s mind entirely. Niklas Luhmann, philosopher and sociologist from 20th century, defined society as a closed system of communication : “Humans cannot communicate; not even their brains can communicate; not even their conscious minds can communicate. Only communication can communicate”. 3

                <div class='title2'id='absolute'>ABSOLUTE UNDERSTANDING</div>
        Since there is no method for reaching an absolute understanding ‘societies have always been shaped more by the nature of the media by which men communicate then by the content of the communication.’ 1 And therefore, I see a strong connection between the media and our perception of the world around us. ‘Perception is the process of attaining awareness or understanding of the environment by organising and interpreting sensory information. All perception involves signals in the nervous system, which in turn result from physical stimulation of sense organs. […] Perception seems mostly effortless because this processing happens outside conscious awareness.’ 5

        <div class='societyone' id='societyonefour'>
                <div class='title2'id='juvenoia'>JUVENOIA AND ANXIETY</div>
        In my opinion the concept of ‘juvenoia' is a good example of how media is changing our perception. ‘Juvenoia’ is a term for phenomena of exaggerated anxiety that older generation often has about the influence of social change on children and youth. New generation, adapts to the new technology, and grows up with a different perception of the world. For instance, Socrates had his concerns about the invention of alphabet and writing: “Discovery of the alphabet will create forgetfulness in the learner’s souls, because they will not use their memories; they will trust the external written characters and not remember of themselves…”. 2

        <div class='societyone' id='societyonefive'>
                <div class='title2'id='portable'>PORTABLE BOOK</div>
        Same tendencies were seen in the period of the invention of print. Print made it possible to created a portable book, movable piece of information, available for reading alone–a totally different kind of experience. It also brought the notion of commodity and individualism in the sphere of information. The fear and anxiety towards the print was also expressed in numerous late-medieval engravings with the theme ‘The Dance of Death’.

                                Obviously technologies and communication methods continue developing further. The story repeats itself with the invention of electronic technology. “The medium, or process, of our time–electric technology–is reshaping and reconstructing patterns of social interdependence and every aspect of our personal life. It is forcing us to reconsider and re-evaluate practically every thought, every action, and every institution formerly taken for granted”.(M. McLuhan)1 Despite all the concerns about these changes, we can not prevent technology from going further. Neither can we decline the promising glimpse of a new way of communicating, which eventually be invented, and perhaps will give a bigger sense of connection between us.</div>

                                In the article ‘Globalizing Intimacy: The Role of Information and Communication Technologies in Maintaining and Creating Relationships’ by Gill Valentine, the author is elaborating on the concerns of older generation on how internet brings isolation and changes in understanding of intimate relationships between people. However, she is also offering a new fresh perspective on the topic. Gill Valentine is claiming that relationships not necessarily become more distant, but simply turn into a different kind of relationships–intimacy at a different level. ‘Both Giddens (1991) and Beck and Beck-Gernsheim (1995) claim that profound changes are occurring in the sphere of intimacy in the context of contemporary process of individualization, detraditionalization, and increased self-reflexivity. In the transformation from industrial society to new modernity, traditional ideas and expectations about social relations are being reworked.’8 Intimacy by default implies physical proximity, ‘…  Yet distance does not necessarily bring intimacy to an end; growing numbers of people “live apart together”’9. Availability of electronic forms of communication in complex with globalisation encourages the development of this kind of relationships further. ‘Early public discourses about the Internet assumed that because it is a disembodied from of communication, it would be impersonal and facilitate deceit, so reducing trust and accountability in online social relations. […] However, numerous studies have demonstrated that these fears have been overstated (e.g., Hollaway and Valentine 2003). Indeed, some research suggests that online exchanges are characterised by higher levels of self-disclosure or hyperpersonal communication.’ 9 ‘The Internet expands the opportunities for daily meaningful contact between family members locked in different time-space routines at work, school, traveling, and so on. In this sense online exchanges and daily Internet use are adding a new dimension, rearticulating practices of everyday life and lived spaces (Franklin 2001)’.10 ‘The Internet is not just a tool for maintaining and sustaining existing familial relationships; it can also facilitate the creation of new intimacies’.11</div>

                                    <div class='subtitle' id='media'>MEDIA SHAPES THE PROCESS OF THOUGHT</div>
                                In the well-known article by Nicholas Carr ‘Is Google making us stupid?’ the author is analysing the effect of new media on his ability for deep-reading: “My mind isn’t going—so far as I can tell—but it’s changing. I’m not thinking the way I used to think. I can feel it most strongly when I’m reading”. Thought his research, Carr discovered that he wasn’t the only one feeling this way, and discovered numerous researches on the topic. His conclusion resulted in a statement: reading is not natural for human brain, it is a habit, and a medium influencing the way we think and perceive information. The author is making an assumption that since Internet became a ‘universal media’ we read much more quantity-wise, but it becomes a completely different kind of reading, and different way of perception of information. ‘Media are not just passive channels of information. They shape the process of thought’, ‘our writing equipment takes part in the forming of our thoughts’.</div>

                                    <div class='subtitle' id='right'>RIGHT HEMISPHERE</div>
                                In fact influence of media on perception is not just an abstract concept but has a very direct visible physical impact. Marshall McLuhan in his ‘Global Village’ is going in depth with analysing these processes. 
                                ‘All Western scientific models of communication are–like the Shanon-Weaver model–linear, sequential, and logical as a reflection of the late medieval emphasis on the Greek notion of the efficient causality. Modern scientific theories abstract the figure from the ground. For use in the electric age, a right-brain model of communication is necessary to demonstrate the “all-at-onceness” character of information moving at the speed of light’. 19
                                ’The alphabet created a lineal and visual environment of services and experiences (everything from architecture to highways to representational art ) which contributed to the ascendancy or dominance of the left, or lineal hemisphere’ 21 of the brain. 
                                ‘This conjecture is consistent with the findings of the Russian neyrophysiologist A.R. Luria, who found that the area of the brain which controls linear sequencing, and hence mathematics and scientific thinking, is located in the pre-frontal region of the left hemisphere. […] Luria’s results show that the expression “linear thinking” is not merely a figure of speech, but a mode of activity which is peculiar to the anterior regions of the left hemisphere of the brain’. ‘The alphabet separated and isolated visual space from many other kinds of sensory space involved in senses of smell, touch, kinesthesia, and acoustics’. 
                                ‘The dominance of the left hemisphere (analytic and quantitative)–and by dominant we mean the ability of the left brain to lead the right brain in the context of Western culture–entails the submission or suppression of the right hemisphere; and so, for example, our intelligence tests exist only for measuring  left-hemisphere achievement and take no cognisance of the existence of the (qualitative) right hemisphere. The present electronic age, in its inescapable confrontation with simultaneity, presents the first serious threat to the 2500-year dominance of the left hemisphere’. 22
                                ‘In general, it needs to be noted that left-hemisphere man has very little power to observe or control environments, or to see the patterns change’. 22
                                ‘All of man’s artifacts, of language, of laws, of ideas and hypotheses, of tools, of clothing and computers, all of these are extensions of the human body. Man cannot trust himself with his own artifacts’. 23
                                ‘Communication media of the future will accentuate the extensions of our nervous systems, which can be disembodied and made totally collective’. 24
                                ‘For use in electronic age, a right-hemisphere model of communication is necessary, both because our culture has nearly completed the process of shifting its cognitive modes from the left to the right hemisphere, and because the electronic media themselves are right-hemisphere in their patterns and operation’. </div>

                            ‘In the order of things, ground comes first. […] 
                            The ground of any technology is both the situation 
                            that that gives rise to it as well as the whole environment (medium) 
                            of services and disservices that the technology brings with it. […] 
                            The medium is the message’. 20

                            If our thinking process, perception and social behaviour is being changed by the media, it seems logical to conclude that these changes don’t just stop there. What if we are going to look at the consequences of this influence on the physical world and design. We draw a lot of parallels between orientation on the net and orientation in the physical space. We even operate the same words like ‘getting lost’ or ‘going’ on the website. Moreover, we use electronic technology to help ourselves to orientate in the physical material space as well. And a lot of us are afraid, the same way as Socrates was concerned about loosing ability to remember with the invention of writing, that we are now going to loose the ability to orientate within physical space without the help of our smartphone.

                                <div class='subtitle' id='browsing'>BROWSING THROUGH THE BOOK</div>
                            Reading a book used to imply following a linear narrative. However this doesn’t seem to be necessarily the case anymore. Since print stopped being a ‘universal media’, it obtained very particular qualities. Moreover, due to the changes in our perception the approach towards book-making in design has changed, as well as the value and meaning of the book. Looking at the student jury selection of 32 books for Best Dutch Design Book awards for 2016, a certain pattern appears. For instance, most of the books in the selection are image-based, and don’t contain a lot of textual material. The layout of many books had a certain correlation with the layout of a website: one of the jury members called his experience of looking at one of the books ‘Browsing through the book’. At the same time a lot of book designs were really making an emphasis on the material aspect of the book: the texture and transparency of the paper, quality of print, engravings and various binding methods, combination of different formats–everything that is not possible to do within digital design. Parallel Encyclopaedia, Ornithology, Land, Form/No Form Black Series and other books from the selection are not meant for reading in the traditional sense of this word. They are made for looking at, for holding them, touching them, owning them. These books are not only containers of primarily visual information, but they become an object. One of the designers who really understands new tendencies in book design and making a use of them is Irma Boom, who elaborates on the issue in one of her interviews: ‘I think the Internet has changed books as a phenomenon. Making a book has in fact become a status symbol. It’s a very slow and still medium. The types of books I make tend to have an object-like quality. […] A really good book has a permanent quality, I think. I hope’. 13

                    In my opinion a similar sequence of changes is happening in the sphere of architecture and urban planning. Information is not set in stone, it is not still and it’s not slow either. It is a network, expanding beyond the frames of a 2D linear canvas.

                    As was mentioned before, I find that there is a strong connection between our orientation in physical space and on the web. We associate searching through the internet with being physically present at some particular location.

                     ‘… the consciousness of the data-base user is in two places at once: at the terminal and in the centre of the system’.19 The event of December of 1968 when Apollo astronauts installed a camera on the moon and pointed it on Earth became important not only in technological sense. ‘We were on earth and the moon simultaneously’. 25 And the realisation of this possibility became a starting point for further evolvement of the shift in our brains.

                    The same way as our ‘intimate’ relationships become different, physical and digital spaces become much more in connection rather than in contrast with each other. Especially since we rely so much on the GPS navigation, and use digital data to orientate in the physical space.
                    Of course, electronic technologies have their physical manifestations in form of data-storage facilities, internet cables laid underwater etc.  But I want to draw attention to how the use of these technologies affects public spaces, which are in the direct connection to social and public activities.

                                For instance–Utrecht Centraal Station. Utrecht Centraal is the biggest and the busiest station in the Netherlands, ‘the heart of the Dutch railway network’ as it is proudly being called on its official website.18 Station serves as a major infrastructural point, a junction of all the major transport lines ’…but offers you also places to meet and relax. Utrecht Centraal: more than just a train station’. <br>
                                By 2025 the station is expected to host around 350,000 of travellers per day. Benthem Crouwel Architects has been involved in the development of the train station since 2003. And thirteen years later, the new public transport terminal that will house train, bus and tram platforms under one undulating roof, has opened. Over the next two decades, the number of travellers through Utrecht Central is being expected to increase even more–to about a hundred million per year. Since the previous building could not handle the increasing amounts of passengers, Utrecht Central Station has been rebuilt–three times its original size. During the 13 year design process developed by Jan Benthem and Mels Crouwel, the decision was made to create a flat roof in form of a slight curve ’… as a wave that radiates a dynamic movement and also functions as a natural way finder’. The official opening of the station with the visit from royal Dutch family happened in 2016. However, being in the station in 2017 sill doesn’t give an impression of a finished fully reconstructed building. The concept for the design of the station is published on the official website of the architectural studio. It involves many attractive and positively-orientated phrases like ‘Restaurants, shops, and a possible market gives this promenade the atmosphere of a real city street’, ‘the interior has a reserved allure and modest charm: it is the people, signage, vehicles and other typical additions that make the station alive and vibrant, and give colour and ambiance’ or even ‘this integrated approach to station and station environment reinforces the identity and vitality of the city’. And then it goes further all the way to naming the station ‘The Cathedral of the new era’. It later adds that ‘the station is part of the urban fabric, with logical walkways and a better connection between different city districts’. 
                            </div>

                            <div class='digitaltwo' id='digitaltwotwo'>
                                <div class='subtitle' id='all'>ALL-AT-ONCENESS</div>
                                And here it is–a massive never ending construction, trying to trick you into thinking it is light, open, neutral and transparent. Utrecht Central is one of the examples of new approach to architecture of public spaces: it needs to be all at once–more than just a train station. As any piece of information on the web it is interlinked with many others, Utrecht Centraal is literally pierced through not only with numerous railways, but with roads and tracks for trams, busses, cars, bicycles and filled with increasing amount of functionalities. Utrecht Central spacial organisation is almost the opposite of the Haarlem Station, which still keeps the traces of its very first design from 1839. At the Haarlem Station the linear sort of composition is prominent. Spaces have single function–even waiting rooms were separated according to the classes: first, second and third, not more than that. The all-at-onceness is foreign there. <br>
                                I do understand the intentions behind such a solution for Utrecht Central. During the 1990s the station was so and so. The changes were absolutely necessary and architects’ aim was to satisfy the needs of ever expanding audience of travellers. The topic of comfort is repeating in the interviews with the main architect Pieter van Rooj from Benthem Crouwel Architects. However my experience of going through Utrecht Central was not filled with comfort. In fact, exactly the opposite happened.
                            </div>

                                The first time I ended up at the Utrecht Central Station, I got lost and had to ask for help to find a right way out. It has a few entrances and exits leading to different parts of the city. At this point the navigation within the physical space of the station doesn’t clearly show which way and due to station’s gigantic sizes, this information is crucial. Another major detail that attracted my attention, something that i noticed at other, renovated by the same architects stations, was a number of huge led screens placed in the main hall. My first expectation was to see the train schedule on them, however they were places with an absolutely different purpose–advertising. The small few screens with the schedule were placed in the way, not comparable with the visibility of the big one. In fact, to read something from the small screen, you have to make a tangible way through the crowd. I felt like I was not among the major part of the travellers who were predominantly checking the train schedule on their gadgets. I am talking about the big screen with the timetable as just a detail, one of many, but if to take a look at it closely, taking away such an element from the public space of the train station brings a big change in the social behaviour. It made me think of a portable book, which once was invented and then irrevocably changed the perception and thinking. The little pocket book, or in this case the smartphone completely replaced the function of the monumental timetable at the entrance of the station.

                                So my first visit to Utrecht Central didn’t become a positive experience, however after a couple of months after I have noticed a significant change. No, going through the station didn’t become more pleasant, but I definitely felt a certain change and station’s influence on my behaviour. Since I didn’t have to think anymore where I should go, obviously I knew my way in and out, I was in a kind of ‘zoned out’ mode each time on my way through. I didn’t have any reason at all to communicate with anybody–my OV-card can be updated trough the machine, my schedule is on smartphone and I could buy my snack at the Albert Heijn with contactless and ‘humanless’ cashier. Reading about the Herbert Krugman brain-wave studies, I noticed some similarities with how I felt. Herbet Krugman’s study describes a ‘subject’ watching a TV. Within 30 seconds of looking at the TV screen the ‘subject’ went into the alpha state–‘relaxed, passive, unfocused’25, typical to the right hemisphere activity mode. Krugman concluded his experiments with: ‘… The unique power of the electronic media is to shape the content of people’s imagery, and in that particular way detrain their behaviour and their views’.
